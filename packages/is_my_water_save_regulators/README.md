- Uses optimized views: `system_health_dashboard`, `county_summary`, `violation_trends`
- Robust error handling with fallback data
- Connection status monitoring

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   # Ensure Supabase is running locally
   cd ../.. && supabase start
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **View Dashboard**
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Dashboard loads with real Georgia water system data

## üìã **Dashboard Sections**

## üé® **Design Philosophy**

**Meeting-Ready**: Clean, professional interface perfect for regulator presentations
**Action-Oriented**: Red/Yellow/Green health indicators for immediate decision-making  
**Data-Driven**: Real metrics from Georgia's SDWIS data
**Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## üîç **Key Insights Enabled**

1. **Resource Prioritization**: Which counties need immediate attention?
2. **Population Impact**: How many Georgians are affected by violations?
3. **Trend Analysis**: Are violations increasing or decreasing?
4. **System Health**: Quick visual assessment of statewide compliance

## üöÄ **Perfect for Speed Trials**

This dashboard demonstrates:
- **Fast Implementation**: Built using modern AI-assisted development
